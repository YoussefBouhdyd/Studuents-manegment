# Student Management 
> A simplified console application in C language that will perform all necessary operations to simplify student management.

## Installation
To build the project, simply run 'make' in the terminal.  
This will compile all source files and generate the 'main' executable.  
To clean up the generated files, run 'make clean'.  
This will delete the 'main' executable.

## Usage
Once you run the 'main' executable, a menu containing all tasks will be displayed.  
You just need to type the number of the task you want to select, and the task will be executed.

## Additional Information
**!**: This project is divided into two distinct parts. You will need to follow the same installation and usage steps for each part.  
**!**: The first program generally works but is just a model. I recommend using the second program.  
**!**: The difference between the two parts is that the first part does not have a database, while the second part does.
